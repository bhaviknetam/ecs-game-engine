# üïπÔ∏è Entity Component System (ECS) for Game Development

This project is a lightweight and efficient implementation of an **Entity Component System (ECS)**, a software architecture pattern commonly used in game development. ECS helps in organizing game logic and data by promoting composition over inheritance, which improves flexibility, performance, and scalability.

## üí° What is an Entity Component System?

ECS is built on three main building blocks:

- **Entity**: A general-purpose object represented by a unique ID. It has no logic or data by itself.
- **Component**: Pure data containers that hold attributes (e.g., position, velocity, health). Components are assigned to entities.
- **System**: Logic that operates on entities with specific components (e.g., a physics system processes entities with Position and Velocity).

This approach promotes **data-oriented design**, enabling efficient memory access and better performance, especially for large-scale simulations and games.

## üß© Components Planned

Below is a list of core components:

| Component      | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `Transform`    | Stores position, rotation, and scale of the entity. |
| `Velocity`     | Defines movement speed and direction. |
| `Sprite`       | Contains rendering information like texture ID, size, etc. |
| `Collider`     | Used for collision detection (bounding box or radius). |
| `RigidBody`    | Handles physics-related data like mass and force. |
| `Health`       | Manages health points and damage logic. |
| `Input`        | Maps player input to entity actions. |
| `AI`           | Stores AI state for non-player characters. |
| `Script`       | Allows attaching custom logic to entities. |
| `Animation`    | Tracks animation state and playback. |
| `Camera`       | Defines view parameters and target focus. |

More components can be added modularly based on game requirements.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecs-game-engine.git
   cd ecs-game-engine
   ```

2. Build the project (example with CMake):
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. Run the engine or example demo:
   ```bash
   ./ecs_demo
   ```

## üîß Design Goals

- Minimalistic and modular
- Cache-friendly for performance
- Easy to extend and maintain
- Platform-independent (C++17 or later)
